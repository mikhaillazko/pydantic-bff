# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for env + deps, [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for lint/format, and [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) for type checking.

```bash
uv sync                                  # install project + dev deps into .venv
uv run pytest                            # full suite (unit + integration)
uv run pytest fastbff/router_test.py     # one test module
uv run pytest fastbff/router_test.py::test_name   # one test
uv run ruff check . --fix                # lint + autofix
uv run ruff format .                     # format
uv run ty check fastbff                  # type check (only the package, not tests)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files        # everything CI runs
```

CI matrix runs Python 3.12, 3.13, 3.14. The local pin is in `.python-version`.

## Test layout

`pytest` is configured (`pyproject.toml`) to discover `*_test.py` files under both `fastbff/` and the project root:

- **Unit tests** are colocated with the module they exercise (`fastbff/router.py` → `fastbff/router_test.py`).
- **Integration tests** live in `integration_tests/` and assemble a real FastBFF app on top of FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite (`integration_tests/sample_app.py` is the shared fixture; tests drive it via `TestClient`).
- Sdist/wheel builds exclude `**/*_test.py` (see `[tool.hatch.build.targets.*]`).

`conftest.py` provides `app`, `query_router`, and `query_executor` fixtures.

## Architecture

`fastbff` is a declarative BFF layer that composes Pydantic response models out of independently registered "queries" and "transformers", with FastAPI-native dependency injection and automatic N+1 avoidance. The big idea: a Pydantic field's `Annotated[...]` metadata declares *how* to populate it; the framework handles batching, caching, and DI.

### Composition root: `FastBFF` + `QueryRouter`

- `QueryRouter` (`fastbff/router.py`) is a pure registry — it collects `@router.queries` and `@router.transformer` callables with their `QueryAnnotation` / `TransformerAnnotation` metadata. No DI wiring.
- `FastBFF` (`fastbff/app.py`) owns a single internal `QueryRouter`, the `query_type → QueryAnnotation` index, and the FastAPI `dependency_overrides` map. `app.include_router(router)` merges a router's registrations into the app and raises `QueryRegistrationError` on duplicates.
- `FastBFF.finalize()` (called implicitly by `mount` and `entrypoint`) walks every registered handler, dedups their `Annotated[..., Depends(...)]` params, and synthesises a `provide_query_executor(**deps)` factory whose `__signature__` declares those deps as keyword-only parameters. FastAPI's `get_dependant` reads `__signature__`, so the synthetic factory plugs straight into FastAPI's resolver.
- `app.mount(fastapi_app)` copies `dependency_overrides` (including `QueryExecutor → provide_query_executor`) into the user-owned FastAPI app. Endpoints then declare `Annotated[QueryExecutor, Depends(QueryExecutor)]` and FastAPI resolves a fresh executor per request.
- `app.entrypoint(func)` runs `func` offline by driving `solve_dependencies` through a synthetic `Request` via `asyncio.run` — used for CLIs / scripts / tests that want full DI without an HTTP server.
- Any registration call invalidates the finalised factory (`_invalidate_finalize`); finalize is idempotent and re-runs only when the handler set changes.

### `QueryExecutor` and the two cache layers

`QueryExecutor` (`fastbff/query_executor/query_executor.py`) is per-request and holds:

1. The shared `query_type → QueryAnnotation` index from the app.
2. A `resolved_deps` dict — the kwargs FastAPI resolved for `provide_query_executor`.
3. A `handler_index[func][arg_name] → synthetic_name | QUERY_EXECUTOR_SENTINEL` mapping.

`fetch(query_obj)` looks up the registered handler, calls `deps_for(handler)` to build its kwargs from the resolved-deps map (substituting `self` wherever `QUERY_EXECUTOR_SENTINEL` appears), then dispatches through `QueryCache`:

- **Call-level cache** for plain return types (key = handler + args).
- **Entity-level cache** for `dict[K, V]`-returning queries that have an `Iterable[K]` field on their `Query` subclass. Overlapping ID sets share cached entries, only missing IDs are fetched from the underlying handler. Absences are remembered, so re-asking does not re-hit the backend.

Setting `QueryExecutor.__signature__ = Signature([])` at module bottom is load-bearing: it stops FastAPI's `get_dependant` from treating `__init__` params as request params when an endpoint declares `Depends(QueryExecutor)`. The override to `provide_query_executor` fires at solve time.

### `validate_batch` + `BatchArg` + `TransformerAnnotation`

`validate_batch(Model, rows, query_executor=...)` (`fastbff/batch.py`) is the two-phase orchestrator for a page of rows:

- **Phase 1 — Plan.** `populate_context_with_batch` walks rows once and collects every unique id per `BatchArg`-aware transformer field into a `{batch_key: set[ids]}` validation context, then injects the `query_executor` into that context.
- **Phase 2 — Merge.** `Model.model_validate(row, context=ctx)` for each row. `TransformerAnnotation.__get_pydantic_core_schema__` registers a `with_info_plain_validator_function` so each transformer runs as a Pydantic validator. The first row's `query_executor.fetch(...)` issues the bulk call; subsequent rows hit the entity-level cache.

`build_transform_annotated(func)` returns `Annotated[ReturnType, transformer_annotation]` so the same transformer can be reused as a field type across multiple Pydantic models. The function is left unchanged and remains directly callable in tests; `transformer_callable` / `transformer_metadata` recover the underlying callable from a function or annotated field.

### Query type metadata (`QueryAnnotation`)

`QueryAnnotation` (`fastbff/query_executor/query_annotation.py`) is computed once per `@queries` registration. It detects the `Query[T]` parameter (or accepts an explicit `@queries(SomeQueryType)` form for parameterless handlers), validates the return type matches `Query[T]`, and pre-computes `dict[K, V]` metadata + the IDs field name so `QueryExecutor.fetch` can route into the entity-level cache without re-reflecting at runtime.

### Errors

All errors subclass `FastBFFError` (`fastbff/exceptions.py`). The most common ones surface at registration / include time, not at request time — `QueryRegistrationError` for bad `@queries` declarations and duplicates, `TransformerRegistrationError` for bad `@transformer` declarations, `BatchContextMissingError` when a `BatchArg` transformer is invoked outside `validate_batch`.

## Conventions

- `ruff` is configured with `force-single-line = true` for imports and single-quote `format.quote-style`. Don't reformat into parenthesised import groups.
- `ty` is in `warn` mode for the rules that conflict with Pydantic/FastAPI runtime dynamism (`unresolved-attribute`, `invalid-return-type`, `invalid-type-form`, `invalid-method-override`). Don't tighten those without checking what breaks.
- Python 3.12+ is required (PEP 695 generics are used throughout: `class Foo[T]:`, `def f[F: Callable](...)`).
- The package ships with `py.typed`; runtime deps are `pydantic>=2,<3` and `fastapi>=0.100`.
