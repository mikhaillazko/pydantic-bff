    """A bundle of query and transformer registrations not yet attached to an app.

    Use ``@router.queries`` and ``@router.transformer`` exactly like the
    decorators on a :class:`BFF` app. Pass the router to
    :meth:`BFF.include_router` to merge its registrations into the app::

        router = QueryRouter()

        @router.queries

    Registrations capture the router's own :class:`InjectorRegistry`. When the
    router is included in an app, the router's DI plumbing is swapped to share
    the app's, so already-wrapped callables resolve dependencies through the
    app's overrides at runtime.
